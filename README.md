# Project Development Overview

## 🚀 Steps to Run the App

Open the project in Xcode and ensure that the Kingfisher project dependency is fetched successfully. Then, run the project as you would with any standard iOS application.

## 🎯 Focus Areas

I prioritized executing and meeting all of the project's acceptance criteria comprehensively. My goal was to demonstrate a holistic approach to iOS development, touching on multiple critical aspects of the project.

## ⏱️ Time Allocation

**Total Time Spent: Approximately 4 hours**

- **Project Understanding**: ~1 hour
  - Carefully reviewed requirements and project specifications
- **Development and Build**: ~2 hours
  - Implemented core functionalities
  - Ensured acceptance criteria were met
- **Code Polishing**: ~1 hour
  - Refined code quality
  - Performed final checks and improvements

## 🤔 Trade-offs and Strategic Decisions

Given the comprehensive nature of the assessment, I opted for a broad approach that covered:
- User Interface
- Architectural Design
- Testing Strategies

While I would have preferred to deeply specialize in a specific area like UI design (refactoring out subviews for starters), the project demanded a well-rounded demonstration of iOS development skills.

## 🧐 Project Assessment

### Potential Improvement Area
The user interface is currently minimalistic. With more time, I would focus on enhancing the visual design and user experience.

## 📦 External Dependencies

**Kingfisher Library**
- *Purpose*: Image caching
- *Rationale*: Leveraged a well-established library with nearly a decade of development to handle image caching efficiently, avoiding reinventing existing solutions
